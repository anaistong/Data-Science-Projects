# My Data Science Project Repository

## Overview
I have completed DataCamp's Associate Data Scientist in Python pathway, and this repository contains all the projects I completed during the course.

## Project 1 - Investigating Netflix Movies
- In this project I explored Netflix movie data and perform exploratory data analysis for a production company to uncover insights about movies from a particular decade, using data manipulation and data visualisation skills.

## Project 2 - Exploring NYC Public School Test Result Scores
- In this project I used data manipulation and summary statistics to analyze test scores across New York City's public schools.

## Project 3 - Visualizing the History of Nobel Prize Winners
- In this project I used data manipulation and visualization skills to explore the history of Nobel Prize.

## Project 4 - Analyzing Crime in Los Angeles
- In this project I explored when and where crime is most likely to occur, along with the types of crimes commonly committed in LA.

## Project 5 - Customer Analytics: Preparing Data for Modeling
- In this project I applied my knowledge of data types and categorical data to prepare a big dataset for modeling.

## Project 6 - Exploring Airbnb Market Trends
- In this project I applied my importing and cleaning data and data manipulation skills to explore New York City Airbnb data.

## Project 7 - Modeling Car Insurance Claim Outcomes
- In this project I cleaned customer data and used logistic regression to predict whether people will make a claim on their car insurance.

## Project 8 - Hypothesis Testing with Men's and Women's Soccer Matches
- In this project I performed a hypothesis test to determine if more goals are scored in women's soccer matches than men's.

## Project 9 - Predictive Modeling for Agriculture
- In this project I used upervised machine learning and feature selection to aid a farmer select the best crop for his field.

## Project 11 - Clustering Antarctic Penguin Species
- In this project I utilised unsupervised learning to cluster a dataset of penguins into species-based groups.

## Project 12 - Predicting Movie Rental Durations
- Using my regression knowledge, I built a regression model which will help predict the number of days a customer rents a DVD.
